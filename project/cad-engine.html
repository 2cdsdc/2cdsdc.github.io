  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved the complete CAD design and assembly of a V6
    internal combustion engine. The goal was to model realistic components
    and validate mechanical motion.

  <h2>Engineering Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Parametric modeling techniques were used for all components.
    Assembly constraints and mates were applied to simulate real motion.
    Interference checks and motion studies were performed.

  <h2>Results & Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    The final assembly demonstrated smooth operation without interferences.
    This project strengthened understanding of complex assemblies and
    real-world mechanical constraints.
